	<p>Selangor (/səˈlæŋə/; Malay: [s(ə)laŋo(r)]),[5] also known by its Arabic honorific Darul Ehsan, or "Abode of Sincerity", is one of the 13 states of Malaysia. It is on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and is bordered by Perak to the north, Pahang to the east, Negeri Sembilan to the south and the Strait of Malacca to the west. It surrounds the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, both of which were previously part of Selangor.

The state capital is Shah Alam, while Klang serves as the royal capital. Another major city is Petaling Jaya, which was awarded city status in 2006. Selangor is one of only three Malaysian states with more than one city; the other two are Sarawak and Johor.[6][7]

The state of Selangor has the largest economy in Malaysia in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) with RM 239.968 billion (roughly USD 55.5 billion) in 2015, making up 22.6% of the total GDP of Malaysia.[8] This state is also the most developed in Malaysia with good infrastructure such as highways and transport. The state also has the largest population in Malaysia, with a high standard of living and the state's poverty rate is the lowest in the country.[9]</p>
